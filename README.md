PROJECT STATEMENT:
A typical Regression Machine Learning project leverages historical data to predict insights into the future. This project aims at predicting Life Expectancy rate of a country given various features. Life expectancy is a statistical measure of the average time a human being is expected to live. It can depend on various factors - Regional variations, Economic circumstances, Sex differences, Mental & Physical illnesses, Education, Year of their birth and other demographic factors. This project provides a way to predict average life expectancy of people living in a country when various factors such as year, GDP, education, alcohol intake of people in the country, expenditure on healthcare system and some specific disease related deaths that happened in the country are given.
